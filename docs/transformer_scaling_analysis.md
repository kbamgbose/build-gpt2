## 1. Attention: Naive vs FlashAttention

**Script:** `python profiling/profile_attention.py`
**Output:** `profiling/attention_kernels.csv`

| seq_len | naive_ms | flash_ms | naive_mb | flash_mb | speedup |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| 256     |          |          |          |          |         |
| 512     |          |          |          |          |         |
| 1024    |          |          |          |          |         |
| 2048    |          |          |          |          |         |
| 4096    |          |          |          |          |         |

**Key observations:**
- [ ] naive memory grows ~4x each time T doubles (O(n²))
- [ ] flash memory stays roughly flat (never materializes T×T matrix)
- [ ] speedup increases with sequence length as memory bottleneck worsens

**Why FlashAttention wins on memory:**
Naive attention materializes the full `(B, n_head, T, T)` matrix in HBM (high bandwidth memory). At T=4096 with B=4, n_head=12, bfloat16 that's `4 * 12 * 4096 * 4096 * 2 bytes ≈ 1.6 GB` — just for the attention scores, before activations. FlashAttention tiles the computation so it fits in SRAM (on-chip cache), reading/writing HBM far less often. Same math, fraction of the memory traffic.

## 2. Scaling: Context Length

**Script:** `python profiling/scaling_experiment.py`
Fixed: n_layer=12, n_embd=768, n_head=12, B=4

| T    | latency_ms | peak_mb | mem_ratio | lat_ratio |
|------|------------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 256  |            |         | 1.00x     | 1.00x     |
| 512  |            |         |           |           |
| 1024 |            |         |           |           |
| 2048 |            |         |           |           |

**Expected:** both memory and latency grow ~4x per doubling of T.

**Why it's O(n²):**
The attention score matrix is `(T, T)` per head. Doubling T → 4x the entries → 4x memory and 4x compute for `Q @ K^T` and `att @ V`. Every other operation in the transformer (MLP, LayerNorm, embeddings) is O(T) — attention is the only quadratic term, and it dominates at long context.

## 3. Scaling: Model Width

**Script:** `python profiling/scaling_experiment.py`
Fixed: n_layer=12, T=512, B=4

| n_embd | params_M | flops_G | latency_ms | peak_mb |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|---------|
| 384    |          |         |            |         |
| 768    |          |         |            |         |
| 1536   |          |         |            |         |

**Expected:** FLOPs and latency grow ~4x per doubling of n_embd.

**Why:** Every matmul in the transformer (QKV projection, output projection, MLP) has `n_embd` on both dimensions. Doubling width → 4x FLOPs per matmul. Unlike sequence length, this is a pure compute cost — the memory growth is from larger weight matrices, not activation tensors.

**Depth vs width tradeoff:**
- More layers (depth) = linear cost — each layer adds fixed compute
- Wider model (n_embd) = quadratic cost — matmul sizes grow in both dimensions
- In practice: depth is cheaper per parameter for most tasks; width helps with memorization capacity

## 4. Block Depth Experiment

**Script:** `python profiling/block_size_experiment.py`
Fixed: n_embd=768, n_head=12, T=1024, B=4

| n_layer | params_M | latency_ms | peak_mb | ms/layer |
|---------|----------|------------|---------|----------|
| 6       |          |            |         |          |
| 12      |          |            |         |          |
| 24      |          |            |         |          |

**Expected:** latency scales linearly with n_layer; ms/layer stays constant.

**Key insight:** Adding layers is O(n_layer) in compute. The O(n²) from attention is *within* each layer at fixed T — it doesn't compound across layers. Doubling layers doubles cost. Doubling T quadruples cost per layer *and* across all layers.

## 5. Edge Cases

**Script:** `python profiling/edge_cases.py`

### 5a. Long sequence memory limits (naive vs flash)

| seq_len | naive    | flash    |
|---------|----------|----------|
| 1024    |          |          |
| 2048    |          |          |
| 4096    |          |          |
| 8192    |          |          |
| 16384   |          |          |

*(values: memory in MB, or OOM)*

### 5b. Numerical stability by dtype (T=1024)

| dtype    | naive NaN | flash NaN | max_val |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| float32  |           |           |         |
| float16  |           |           |         |
| bfloat16 |           |           |         |

### 5c. Stability at large magnitude inputs (scale=100)

| dtype    | naive NaN | flash NaN |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| float32  |           |           |
| float16  |           |           |
| bfloat16 |           |           |

**Why bfloat16 > float16 for training:**
Both have 16 bits total. float16 splits them as 1 sign + 5 exponent + 10 mantissa. bfloat16 uses 1 + 8 + 7. The wider exponent (8 bits = same as float32) means bfloat16 can represent values up to ~3.4×10³⁸ vs float16's ~65,504. Pre-softmax attention scores can easily exceed 65,504 at large T or with unscaled inputs — that's where float16 NaNs come from. bfloat16 survives because its exponent range matches float32.

**Why FlashAttention is more stable:**
Standard softmax reads all scores, computes `exp(x_i) / sum(exp(x_j))`. If any score is large, `exp` overflows. FlashAttention uses *online softmax*: it tracks a running max and rescales as it goes, so no single score ever dominates the computation. Numerically equivalent result, more stable execution.

## Summary

| Dimension | Cost | Dominant operation |
|-----------|------|--------------------|
| T (seq len) | O(n²) | attention matmul |
| n_embd (width) | O(n²) | all linear projections |
| n_layer (depth) | O(n) | stacked forward passes |
| FlashAttention vs naive | ~same FLOPs, far less memory | HBM traffic |

**Takeaway:** sequence length is the most expensive thing you can scale in a transformer. Width is the second most expensive. Depth is the cheapest. FlashAttention doesn't reduce FLOPs — it reduces memory movement, which is the real bottleneck on modern GPUs.
